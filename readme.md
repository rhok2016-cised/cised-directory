CISED Directory Project is an interactive platform that enables consumers of all types to sources goods and services from Ottawa’s vibrant social enterprise sector

More and more purchasers at the individual, corporate, and public level want to leverage their purchasing dollars for greater social and economic impact. At the same time, Ottawa-based social enterprises are searching for innovative marketing tools to extend their reach and build profile for a growing range of products and services.
[The Centre for Innovative Social Enterprise Development (CISED)](http://www.cised.ca/) knows that the next step is the development of an innovative online marketplace where purchasers and suppliers can connect – one that will generate commerce, build awareness, and grow community impact.

Our first iteration in the development of the Ottawa SE MarketPlace is the creation of a web directory which will house information about individual social enterprises – from social purpose, to products and services offered, to financial data. This database will provide a comprehensive and searchable platform for knowing, documenting, tracking and finding social enterprise suppliers in Ottawa.  

Features include:
* Ability for new prospective social enterprises to submit an application through a web form to be considered for inclusion in the directory. CISED will receive the application in Wordpress as a Social Enterprise entry in Draft mode. After reviewing the submitted data, they can accept the application by publishing the entry.
